# WT_assignment_2

This repository contains two beginner-friendly web development projects that demonstrate dynamic content rendering, UI interactivity, and state management using both vanilla JavaScript and ReactJS.

- Task 1: Dynamic Product Catalog using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript  
- Task 2: Simple To-Do List App using ReactJS



ðŸ“¦ Task 1: Dynamic Product Catalog (HTML + CSS + JS)

This is a basic e-commerce product catalog interface built using only front-end web technologies. It showcases 10 different products (e.g., laptops, books, mobiles) with details like an image, title, and price. Each product also includes an "Add to Cart" button that triggers a feedback alert.


Features

- Products are dynamically rendered using a JavaScript array and loops
- On clicking "Add to Cart", a pop-up alert shows "Product added!"
- The layout uses CSS Flexbox to display items in a responsive grid
- Interactive hover effects such as zoom-in and shadow for better UX

  
How to Run

1. Navigate to the `task1` folder in your file explorer.
2. Locate the `index.html` file.
3. Right-click on `index.html` and choose "Open with" > your preferred browser (e.g., Chrome, Firefox, Edge), or double-click the file to open it in your default browser.
4. The webpage will load locally without any need for installation or internet connection.



âœ… Task 2: To-Do List App (ReactJS)

This is a functional To-Do List application built using ReactJS. It allows users to manage daily tasks â€” adding new ones, marking them as completed, and deleting them. The interface is clean, and completed tasks are visually distinguished. An optional filter lets users view all, active, or completed tasks.

Features

- Uses `useState` hook for dynamic state management
- Users can add tasks using an input field, delete them, or mark as completed
- Completed tasks appear with strikethrough and colored background
- Components communicate via props for a modular structure
- Bonus: Includes a filter feature (All / Active / Completed)

How to Run:

1. Make sure Node.js and npm are installed on your machine.  
   You can check using the commands:
  
    > node -v
    > npm -v

2. Open a terminal or command prompt and navigate to the task2 folder:

    > cd path/to/task2

3. Install dependencies:

    > npm install

4. Start the development server:

    > npm start

5. The app will open automatically in your browser at `http://localhost:3000`.
